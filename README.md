# Gospel Library

This project is not to be used as a scriptural reference _what so ever_.

This project is not affliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ICS department.

The goal of this project is just to see the advantages and disadvantages of using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) compared to the [current implementation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study?lang=eng).

## requirements

1. Develop a web scraper binary with Rust that can make the whole project.

2. Integrate that binary with the build process here.

3. Utilize verses in project for [Hugo headless mode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/).

4. The headless mode also needs to support JSON, or have a different area for that as well.
