  1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then
  Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
</p>
<p>
  2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this
  day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
</p>
<p>
  3 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions
  which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
</p>
<p>
  4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own
  nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
</p>
<p>
  5 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most
  straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
</p>
<p>
  6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto
  our fathers:
</p>
<p>
  7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night,
  hope to come. For which hope&#x2019;s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the
  Jews.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise
  the dead?
</p>
<p>
  9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the
  name of Jesus of Nazareth.
</p>
<p>
  10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up
  in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they
  were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
</p>
<p>
  11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to
  blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto
  strange cities.
</p>
<p>
  12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the
  chief priests,
</p>
<p>
  13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the
  brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with
  me.
</p>
<p>
  14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me,
  and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is
  hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
</p>
<p>
  15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou
  persecutest.
</p>
<p>
  16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this
  purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou
  hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;
</p>
<p>
  17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I
  send thee,
</p>
<p>
  18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the
  power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
  inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
</p>
<p>
  19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
</p>
<p>
  20 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout
  all the coasts of Jud&#xE6;a, and then to the Gentiles, that they should
  repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
</p>
<p>
  21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill
  me.
</p>
<p>
  22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing
  both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the
  prophets and Moses did say should come:
</p>
<p>
  23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise
  from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
</p>
<p>
  24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou
  art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
</p>
<p>
  25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of
  truth and soberness.
</p>
<p>
  26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for
  I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing
  was not done in a corner.
</p>
<p>27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
</p>
<p>
  29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear
  me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these
  bonds.
</p>
<p>
  30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and
  Bernice, and they that sat with them:
</p>
<p>
  31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This
  man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
</p>
<p>
  32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if
  he had not appealed unto C&#xE6;sar.
