<p>
  1 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not
  the grace of God in vain.
</p>
<p>
  2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of
  salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now
  is the day of salvation.)
</p>
<p>3 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</p>
<p>
  4 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much
  patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
</p>
<p>
  5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in
  fastings;
</p>
<p>
  6 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost,
  by love unfeigned,
</p>
<p>
  7 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on
  the right hand and on the left,
</p>
<p>
  8 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and
  yet true;
</p>
<p>
  9 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as
  chastened, and not killed;
</p>
<p>
  10 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having
  nothing, and yet possessing all things.
</p>
<p>11 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</p>
<p>12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</p>
<p>
  13 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also
  enlarged.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship
  hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with
  darkness?
</p>
<p>
  15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that
  believeth with an infidel?
</p>
<p>
  16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple
  of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them;
  and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
</p>
<p>
  17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and
  touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,
</p>
<p>
  18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith
  the Lord Almighty.
