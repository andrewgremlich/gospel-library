<p>
  1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater
  condemnation.
</p>
<p>
  2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is
  a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.
</p>
<p>
  3 Behold, we put bits in the horses&#x2019; mouths, that they may obey us; and
  we turn about their whole body.
</p>
<p>
  4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of
  fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever
  the governor listeth.
</p>
<p>
  5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold,
  how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
</p>
<p>
  6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our
  members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of
  nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
</p>
<p>
  7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in
  the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
</p>
<p>
  8 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
</p>
<p>
  9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which
  are made after the similitude of God.
</p>
<p>
  10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these
  things ought not so to be.
</p>
<p>11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>
<p>
  12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so
  can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
</p>
<p>
  13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of
  a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
</p>
<p>
  14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie
  not against the truth.
</p>
<p>
  15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
</p>
<p>
  16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
</p>
<p>
  17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,
  and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality,
  and without hypocrisy.
</p>
<p>
  18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
</p>
