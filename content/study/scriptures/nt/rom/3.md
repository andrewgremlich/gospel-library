<p>
  1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
</p>
<p>
  2 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles
  of God.
</p>
<p>
  3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God
  without effect?
</p>
<p>
  4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written,
  That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when
  thou art judged.
</p>
<p>
  5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we
  say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
</p>
<p>6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
<p>
  7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory;
  why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
</p>
<p>
  8 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we
  say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
</p>
<p>
  9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before
  proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
</p>
<p>10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
<p>
  11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
</p>
<p>
  12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable;
  there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
</p>
<p>
  13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used
  deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
</p>
<p>14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
<p>15 Their feet are swift to shed blood:</p>
<p>16 Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>
<p>17 And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
<p>18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p>
  19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are
  under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
  guilty before God.
</p>
<p>
  20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his
  sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
</p>
<p>
  21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being
  witnessed by the law and the prophets;
</p>
<p>
  22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all
  and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
</p>
<p>23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
<p>
  24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
  Christ Jesus:
</p>
<p>
  25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to
  declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
  forbearance of God;
</p>
<p>
  26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just,
  and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
</p>
<p>
  27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by
  the law of faith.
</p>
<p>
  28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of
  the law.
</p>
<p>
  29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the
  Gentiles also:
</p>
<p>
  30 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and
  uncircumcision through faith.
</p>
<p>
  31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish
  the law.
