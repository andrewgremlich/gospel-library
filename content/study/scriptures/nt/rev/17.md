<p>
  1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked
  with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of
  the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
</p>
<p>
  2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the
  inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
  fornication.
</p>
<p>
  3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman
  sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven
  heads and ten horns.
</p>
<p>
  4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold
  and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of
  abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
</p>
<p>
  5 And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the
  Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.
</p>
<p>
  6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood
  of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
</p>
<p>
  7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee
  the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the
  seven heads and ten horns.
</p>
<p>
  8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the
  bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall
  wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation
  of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
</p>
<p>
  9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains,
  on which the woman sitteth.
</p>
<p>
  10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is
  not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
</p>
<p>
  11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the
  seven, and goeth into perdition.
</p>
<p>
  12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no
  kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
</p>
<p>
  13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the
  beast.
</p>
<p>
  14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for
  he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called,
  and chosen, and faithful.
</p>
<p>
  15 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore
  sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
</p>
<p>
  16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the
  whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and
  burn her with fire.
</p>
<p>
  17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give
  their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
  18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the
  kings of the earth.
</p>
