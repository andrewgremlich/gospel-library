<p>
  1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to my word, and learn of me
  what I will concerning you, and also concerning this land unto which I have
  sent you.
</p>
<p>
  2 For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments,
  whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the
  reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.
</p>
<p>
  3 Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of
  your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory
  which shall follow after much tribulation.
</p>
<p>
  4 For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that
  ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand.
</p>
<p>
  5 Remember this, which I tell you before, that you may lay it to heart, and
  receive that which is to follow.
</p>
<p>
  6 Behold, verily I say unto you, for this cause I have sent you&#x2014;that
  you might be obedient, and that your hearts might be prepared to bear
  testimony of the things which are to come;
</p>
<p>
  7 And also that you might be honored in laying the foundation, and in bearing
  record of the land upon which the Zion of God shall stand;
</p>
<p>
  8 And also that a feast of fat things might be prepared for the poor; yea, a
  feast of fat things, of wine on the lees well refined, that the earth may know
  that the mouths of the prophets shall not fail;
</p>
<p>
  9 Yea, a supper of the house of the Lord, well prepared, unto which all
  nations shall be invited.
</p>
<p>10 First, the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble;</p>
<p>
  11 And after that cometh the day of my power; then shall the poor, the lame,
  and the blind, and the deaf, come in unto the marriage of the Lamb, and
  partake of the supper of the Lord, prepared for the great day to come.
</p>
<p>12 Behold, I, the Lord, have spoken it.</p>
<p>
  13 And that the testimony might go forth from Zion, yea, from the mouth of the
  city of the heritage of God&#x2014;
</p>
<p>
  14 Yea, for this cause I have sent you hither, and have selected my servant
  Edward Partridge, and have appointed unto him his mission in this land.
</p>
<p>
  15 But if he repent not of his sins, which are unbelief and blindness of
  heart, let him take heed lest he fall.
</p>
<p>16 Behold his mission is given unto him, and it shall not be given again.</p>
<p>
  17 And whoso standeth in this mission is appointed to be a judge in Israel,
  like as it was in ancient days, to divide the lands of the heritage of God
  unto his children;
</p>
<p>
  18 And to judge his people by the testimony of the just, and by the assistance
  of his counselors, according to the laws of the kingdom which are given by the
  prophets of God.
</p>
<p>19 For verily I say unto you, my law shall be kept on this land.</p>
<p>
  20 Let no man think he is ruler; but let God rule him that judgeth, according
  to the counsel of his own will, or, in other words, him that counseleth or
  sitteth upon the judgment seat.
</p>
<p>
  21 Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God
  hath no need to break the laws of the land.
</p>
<p>
  22 Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right it
  is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet.
</p>
<p>
  23 Behold, the laws which ye have received from my hand are the laws of the
  church, and in this light ye shall hold them forth. Behold, here is wisdom.
</p>
<p>
  24 And now, as I spake concerning my servant Edward Partridge, this land is
  the land of his residence, and those whom he has appointed for his counselors;
  and also the land of the residence of him whom I have appointed to keep my
  storehouse;
</p>
<p>
  25 Wherefore, let them bring their families to this land, as they shall
  counsel between themselves and me.
</p>
<p>
  26 For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that
  is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant;
  wherefore he receiveth no reward.
</p>
<p>
  27 Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many
  things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;
</p>
<p>
  28 For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And
  inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  29 But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a
  commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is
  damned.
</p>
<p>
  30 Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that
  obeys not my commandments?
</p>
<p>31 Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled?</p>
<p>
  32 I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.
</p>
<p>
  33 Then they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his
  promises are not fulfilled. But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh
  beneath, and not from above.
</p>
<p>34 And now I give unto you further directions concerning this land.</p>
<p>
  35 It is wisdom in me that my servant Martin Harris should be an example unto
  the church, in laying his moneys before the bishop of the church.
</p>
<p>
  36 And also, this is a law unto every man that cometh unto this land to
  receive an inheritance; and he shall do with his moneys according as the law
  directs.
</p>
<p>
  37 And it is wisdom also that there should be lands purchased in Independence,
  for the place of the storehouse, and also for the house of the printing.
</p>
<p>
  38 And other directions concerning my servant Martin Harris shall be given him
  of the Spirit, that he may receive his inheritance as seemeth him good;
</p>
<p>
  39 And let him repent of his sins, for he seeketh the praise of the world.
</p>
<p>
  40 And also let my servant William&#xA0;W. Phelps stand in the office to which
  I have appointed him, and receive his inheritance in the land;
</p>
<p>
  41 And also he hath need to repent, for I, the Lord, am not well pleased with
  him, for he seeketh to excel, and he is not sufficiently meek before me.
</p>
<p>
  42 Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the
  Lord, remember them no more.
</p>
<p>
  43 By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins&#x2014;behold, he will
  confess them and forsake them.
</p>
<p>
  44 And now, verily, I say concerning the residue of the elders of my church,
  the time has not yet come, for many years, for them to receive their
  inheritance in this land, except they desire it through the prayer of faith,
  only as it shall be appointed unto them of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  45 For, behold, they shall push the people together from the ends of the
  earth.
</p>
<p>
  46 Wherefore, assemble yourselves together; and they who are not appointed to
  stay in this land, let them preach the gospel in the regions round about; and
  after that let them return to their homes.
</p>
<p>
  47 Let them preach by the way, and bear testimony of the truth in all places,
  and call upon the rich, the high and the low, and the poor to repent.
</p>
<p>
  48 And let them build up churches, inasmuch as the inhabitants of the earth
  will repent.
</p>
<p>
  49 And let there be an agent appointed by the voice of the church, unto the
  church in Ohio, to receive moneys to purchase lands in Zion.
</p>
<p>
  50 And I give unto my servant Sidney Rigdon a commandment, that he shall write
  a description of the land of Zion, and a statement of the will of God, as it
  shall be made known by the Spirit unto him;
</p>
<p>
  51 And an epistle and subscription, to be presented unto all the churches to
  obtain moneys, to be put into the hands of the bishop, of himself or the
  agent, as seemeth him good or as he shall direct, to purchase lands for an
  inheritance for the children of God.
</p>
<p>
  52 For, behold, verily I say unto you, the Lord willeth that the disciples and
  the children of men should open their hearts, even to purchase this whole
  region of country, as soon as time will permit.
</p>
<p>
  53 Behold, here is wisdom. Let them do this lest they receive none
  inheritance, save it be by the shedding of blood.
</p>
<p>
  54 And again, inasmuch as there is land obtained, let there be workmen sent
  forth of all kinds unto this land, to labor for the saints of God.
</p>
<p>
  55 Let all these things be done in order; and let the privileges of the lands
  be made known from time to time, by the bishop or the agent of the church.
</p>
<p>
  56 And let the work of the gathering be not in haste, nor by flight; but let
  it be done as it shall be counseled by the elders of the church at the
  conferences, according to the knowledge which they receive from time to time.
</p>
<p>
  57 And let my servant Sidney Rigdon consecrate and dedicate this land, and the
  spot for the temple, unto the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  58 And let a conference meeting be called; and after that let my servants
  Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun., return, and also Oliver Cowdery with
  them, to accomplish the residue of the work which I have appointed unto them
  in their own land, and the residue as shall be ruled by the conferences.
</p>
<p>
  59 And let no man return from this land except he bear record by the way, of
  that which he knows and most assuredly believes.
</p>
<p>
  60 Let that which has been bestowed upon Ziba Peterson be taken from him; and
  let him stand as a member in the church, and labor with his own hands, with
  the brethren, until he is sufficiently chastened for all his sins; for he
  confesseth them not, and he thinketh to hide them.
</p>
<p>
  61 Let the residue of the elders of this church, who are coming to this land,
  some of whom are exceedingly blessed even above measure, also hold a
  conference upon this land.
</p>
<p>
  62 And let my servant Edward Partridge direct the conference which shall be
  held by them.
</p>
<p>
  63 And let them also return, preaching the gospel by the way, bearing record
  of the things which are revealed unto them.
</p>
<p>
  64 For, verily, the sound must go forth from this place into all the world,
  and unto the uttermost parts of the earth&#x2014;the gospel must be preached
  unto every creature, with signs following them that believe.
</p>
<p>65 And behold the Son of Man cometh. Amen.</p>
