<p>
  1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go ye, go
  ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under
  the sound of your voice.
</p>
<p>
  2 And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden
  Smith.
</p>
<p>
  3 Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south,
  to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.
</p>
<p>
  4 Therefore, declare the things which ye have heard, and verily believe, and
  know to be true.
</p>
<p>
  5 Behold, this is the will of him who hath called you, your Redeemer, even
  Jesus Christ. Amen.
</p>
