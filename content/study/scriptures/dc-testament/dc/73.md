<p>
  1 For verily, thus saith the Lord, it is expedient in me that they should
  continue preaching the gospel, and in exhortation to the churches in the
  regions round about, until conference;
</p>
<p>
  2 And then, behold, it shall be made known unto them, by the voice of the
  conference, their several missions.
</p>
<p>
  3 Now, verily I say unto you my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney
  Rigdon, saith the Lord, it is expedient to translate again;
</p>
<p>
  4 And, inasmuch as it is practicable, to preach in the regions round about
  until conference; and after that it is expedient to continue the work of
  translation until it be finished.
</p>
<p>
  5 And let this be a pattern unto the elders until further knowledge, even as
  it is written.
</p>
<p>
  6 Now I give no more unto you at this time. Gird up your loins and be sober.
  Even so. Amen.
