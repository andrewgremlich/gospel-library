<p>
  1 Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood
  of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel
  of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this
  shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer
  again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.
