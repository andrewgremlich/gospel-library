<p>
  1 Behold, I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done away
  in this thing; and this is a new and an everlasting covenant, even that which
  was from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
  2 Wherefore, although a man should be baptized an hundred times it availeth
  him nothing, for you cannot enter in at the strait gate by the law of Moses,
  neither by your dead works.
</p>
<p>
  3 For it is because of your dead works that I have caused this last covenant
  and this church to be built up unto me, even as in days of old.
</p>
<p>
  4 Wherefore, enter ye in at the gate, as I have commanded, and seek not to
  counsel your God. Amen.
</p>
