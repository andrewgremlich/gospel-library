<p>
  1 And now concerning my servant Parley&#xA0;P. Pratt, behold, I say unto him
  that as I live I will that he shall declare my gospel and learn of me, and be
  meek and lowly of heart.
</p>
<p>
  2 And that which I have appointed unto him is that he shall go with my
  servants, Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among
  the Lamanites.
</p>
<p>
  3 And Ziba Peterson also shall go with them; and I myself will go with them
  and be in their midst; and I am their advocate with the Father, and nothing
  shall prevail against them.
</p>
<p>
  4 And they shall give heed to that which is written, and pretend to no other
  revelation; and they shall pray always that I may unfold the same to their
  understanding.
</p>
<p>
  5 And they shall give heed unto these words and trifle not, and I will bless
  them. Amen.
</p>
