<p>
  1 Verily thus saith the Lord: It is wisdom in my servant David&#xA0;W. Patten,
  that he settle up all his business as soon as he possibly can, and make a
  disposition of his merchandise, that he may perform a mission unto me next
  spring, in company with others, even twelve including himself, to testify of
  my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world.
</p>
<p>
  2 For verily thus saith the Lord, that inasmuch as there are those among you
  who deny my name, others shall be planted in their stead and receive their
  bishopric. Amen.
