<p>
  1 Behold, it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a
  regular history, and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things
  which shall be given you, until he is called to further duties.
</p>
<p>
  2 Again, verily I say unto you that he can also lift up his voice in meetings,
  whenever it shall be expedient.
</p>
<p>
  3 And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the
  church record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to
  another office.
</p>
<p>
  4 Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the
  Comforter, to write these things. Even so. Amen.
</p>
