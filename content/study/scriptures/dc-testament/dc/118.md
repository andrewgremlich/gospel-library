<p>
  1 Verily, thus saith the Lord: Let a conference be held immediately; let the
  Twelve be organized; and let men be appointed to supply the place of those who
  are fallen.
</p>
<p>
  2 Let my servant Thomas remain for a season in the land of Zion, to publish my
  word.
</p>
<p>
  3 Let the residue continue to preach from that hour, and if they will do this
  in all lowliness of heart, in meekness and humility, and long-suffering, I,
  the Lord, give unto them a promise that I will provide for their families; and
  an effectual door shall be opened for them, from henceforth.
</p>
<p>
  4 And next spring let them depart to go over the great waters, and there
  promulgate my gospel, the fulness thereof, and bear record of my name.
</p>
<p>
  5 Let them take leave of my saints in the city of Far West, on the
  twenty-sixth day of April next, on the building-spot of my house, saith the
  Lord.
</p>
<p>
  6 Let my servant John Taylor, and also my servant John&#xA0;E. Page, and also
  my servant Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant Willard Richards, be
  appointed to fill the places of those who have fallen, and be officially
  notified of their appointment.
