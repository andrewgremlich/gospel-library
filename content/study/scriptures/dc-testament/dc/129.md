<p>
  1 There are two kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected
  personages, having bodies of flesh and bones&#x2014;
</p>
<p>
  2 For instance, Jesus said: Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and
  bones, as ye see me have.
</p>
<p>
  3 Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not
  resurrected, but inherit the same glory.
</p>
<p>
  4 When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand
  and request him to shake hands with you.
</p>
<p>5 If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.</p>
<p>
  6 If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory;
  for that is the only way he can appear&#x2014;
</p>
<p>
  7 Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is
  contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still
  deliver his message.
</p>
<p>
  8 If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he
  will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore
  detect him.
</p>
<p>
  9 These are three grand keys whereby you may know whether any administration
  is from God.
