  1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my servant John Murdock&#x2014;thou art
  called to go into the eastern countries from house to house, from village to
  village, and from city to city, to proclaim mine everlasting gospel unto the
  inhabitants thereof, in the midst of persecution and wickedness.
</p>
<p>
  2 And who receiveth you receiveth me; and you shall have power to declare my
  word in the demonstration of my Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
  3 And who receiveth you as a little child, receiveth my kingdom; and blessed
  are they, for they shall obtain mercy.
</p>
<p>
  4 And whoso rejecteth you shall be rejected of my Father and his house; and
  you shall cleanse your feet in the secret places by the way for a testimony
  against them.
</p>
<p>
  5 And behold, and lo, I come quickly to judgment, to convince all of their
  ungodly deeds which they have committed against me, as it is written of me in
  the volume of the book.
</p>
<p>
  6 And now, verily I say unto you, that it is not expedient that you should go
  until your children are provided for, and sent up kindly unto the bishop of
  Zion.
</p>
<p>
  7 And after a few years, if thou desirest of me, thou mayest go up also unto
  the goodly land, to possess thine inheritance;
</p>
<p>
  8 Otherwise thou shalt continue proclaiming my gospel until thou be taken.
  Amen.
</p>
