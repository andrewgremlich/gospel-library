<p>
  1 It is necessary that ye should remain for the present time in your places of
  abode, as it shall be suitable to your circumstances.
</p>
<p>2 And inasmuch as ye have lands, ye shall impart to the eastern brethren;</p>
<p>
  3 And inasmuch as ye have not lands, let them buy for the present time in
  those regions round about, as seemeth them good, for it must needs be
  necessary that they have places to live for the present time.
</p>
<p>
  4 It must needs be necessary that ye save all the money that ye can, and that
  ye obtain all that ye can in righteousness, that in time ye may be enabled to
  purchase land for an inheritance, even the city.
</p>
<p>
  5 The place is not yet to be revealed; but after your brethren come from the
  east there are to be certain men appointed, and to them it shall be given to
  know the place, or to them it shall be revealed.
</p>
<p>
  6 And they shall be appointed to purchase the lands, and to make a
  commencement to lay the foundation of the city; and then shall ye begin to be
  gathered with your families, every man according to his family, according to
  his circumstances, and as is appointed to him by the presidency and the bishop
  of the church, according to the laws and commandments which ye have received,
  and which ye shall hereafter receive. Even so. Amen.
