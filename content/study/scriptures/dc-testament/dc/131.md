<p>1 In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</p>
<p>
  2 And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the
  priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];
</p>
<p>3 And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</p>
<p>
  4 He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot
  have an increase.
</p>
<p>
  5 (May 17th, 1843.) The more sure word of prophecy means a man&#x2019;s
  knowing that he is sealed up unto eternal life, by revelation and the spirit
  of prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood.
</p>
<p>6 It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.</p>
<p>
  7 There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is
  more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes;
</p>
<p>
  8 We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is
  all matter.
