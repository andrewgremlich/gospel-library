<p>
  1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha&#x2014;There
  are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated
  correctly;
</p>
<p>
  2 There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are
  interpolations by the hands of men.
</p>
<p>
  3 Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be
  translated.
</p>
<p>
  4 Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth
  truth;
</p>
<p>5 And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;</p>
<p>
  6 And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is
  not needful that it should be translated. Amen.
</p>
