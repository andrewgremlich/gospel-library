<p>
  1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you
  have inquired of my hand to know and understand wherein I, the Lord, justified
  my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David and Solomon, my
  servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives
  and concubines&#x2014;
</p>
<p>
  2 Behold, and lo, I am the Lord thy God, and will answer thee as touching this
  matter.
</p>
<p>
  3 Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am
  about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them
  must obey the same.
</p>
<p>
  4 For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye
  abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this
  covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.
</p>
<p>
  5 For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was
  appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted
  from before the foundation of the world.
</p>
<p>
  6 And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for
  the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and
  shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God.
</p>
<p>
  7 And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these: All
  covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances,
  connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into
  and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well
  for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and
  commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the
  earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold
  this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time
  on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred), are of no
  efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for
  all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.
</p>
<p>
  8 Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house
  of confusion.
</p>
<p>
  9 Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my name?
</p>
<p>10 Or will I receive at your hands that which I have not appointed?</p>
<p>
  11 And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be by law, even as I
  and my Father ordained unto you, before the world was?
</p>
<p>
  12 I am the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment&#x2014;that no
  man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith
  the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  13 And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by
  thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may
  be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down,
  and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the
  resurrection, saith the Lord your God.
</p>
<p>
  14 For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are not by me
  shall be shaken and destroyed.
</p>
<p>
  15 Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by
  me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and
  she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead,
  and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law
  when they are out of the world.
</p>
<p>
  16 Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given
  in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering
  servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an
  exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.
</p>
<p>
  17 For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged,
  but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved
  condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels
  of God forever and ever.
</p>
<p>
  18 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a
  covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me
  or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of
  promise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then
  it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, because they
  are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of
  the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are
  appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my
  glory; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God.
</p>
<p>
  19 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which
  is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them
  by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have
  appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said
  unto them&#x2014;Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be
  after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit
  thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and
  depths&#x2014;then shall it be written in the Lamb&#x2019;s Book of Life, that
  he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in
  my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be
  done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in
  time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out
  of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set
  there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon
  their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds
  forever and ever.
</p>
<p>
  20 Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be
  from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be
  above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods,
  because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.
</p>
<p>
  21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to
  this glory.
</p>
<p>
  22 For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation
  and continuation of the lives, and few there be that find it, because ye
  receive me not in the world neither do ye know me.
</p>
<p>
  23 But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive
  your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also.
</p>
<p>
  24 This is eternal lives&#x2014;to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus
  Christ, whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law.
</p>
<p>
  25 Broad is the gate, and wide the way that leadeth to the deaths; and many
  there are that go in thereat, because they receive me not, neither do they
  abide in my law.
</p>
<p>
  26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word,
  and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine
  appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or transgression of the new
  and everlasting covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they
  commit no murder wherein they shed innocent blood, yet they shall come forth
  in the first resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but they shall be
  destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan
  unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God.
</p>
<p>
  27 The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the
  world nor out of the world, is in that ye commit murder wherein ye shed
  innocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and
  everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law can
  in nowise enter into my glory, but shall be damned, saith the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  28 I am the Lord thy God, and will give unto thee the law of my Holy
  Priesthood, as was ordained by me and my Father before the world was.
</p>
<p>
  29 Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and
  commandment, by my word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation
  and sitteth upon his throne.
</p>
<p>
  30 Abraham received promises concerning his seed, and of the fruit of his
  loins&#x2014;from whose loins ye are, namely, my servant Joseph&#x2014;which
  were to continue so long as they were in the world; and as touching Abraham
  and his seed, out of the world they should continue; both in the world and out
  of the world should they continue as innumerable as the stars; or, if ye were
  to count the sand upon the seashore ye could not number them.
</p>
<p>
  31 This promise is yours also, because ye are of Abraham, and the promise was
  made unto Abraham; and by this law is the continuation of the works of my
  Father, wherein he glorifieth himself.
</p>
<p>
  32 Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law and ye
  shall be saved.
</p>
<p>
  33 But if ye enter not into my law ye cannot receive the promise of my Father,
  which he made unto Abraham.
</p>
<p>
  34 God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to wife. And why did
  she do it? Because this was the law; and from Hagar sprang many people. This,
  therefore, was fulfilling, among other things, the promises.
</p>
<p>
  35 Was Abraham, therefore, under condemnation? Verily I say unto you, Nay; for
  I, the Lord, commanded it.
</p>
<p>
  36 Abraham was commanded to offer his son Isaac; nevertheless, it was written:
  Thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however, did not refuse, and it was accounted
  unto him for righteousness.
</p>
<p>
  37 Abraham received concubines, and they bore him children; and it was
  accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he
  abode in my law; as Isaac also and Jacob did none other things than that which
  they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which
  they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the
  promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods.
</p>
<p>
  38 David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses
  my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of
  creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things
  which they received not of me.
</p>
<p>
  39 David&#x2019;s wives and concubines were given unto him of me, by the hand
  of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this
  power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of
  Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and
  received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I
  gave them unto another, saith the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  40 I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee, my servant Joseph, an
  appointment, and restore all things. Ask what ye will, and it shall be given
  unto you according to my word.
</p>
<p>
  41 And as ye have asked concerning adultery, verily, verily, I say unto you,
  if a man receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be
  with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the holy anointing, she
  hath committed adultery and shall be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
  42 If she be not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with another
  man, she has committed adultery.
</p>
<p>
  43 And if her husband be with another woman, and he was under a vow, he hath
  broken his vow and hath committed adultery.
</p>
<p>
  44 And if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent and hath not broken
  her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then
  shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her and give
  her unto him that hath not committed adultery but hath been faithful; for he
  shall be made ruler over many.
</p>
<p>
  45 For I have conferred upon you the keys and power of the priesthood, wherein
  I restore all things, and make known unto you all things in due time.
</p>
<p>
  46 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth shall
  be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name and by my
  word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens; and
  whosesoever sins you remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the
  heavens; and whosesoever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in heaven.
</p>
<p>
  47 And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless I will bless, and whomsoever
  you curse I will curse, saith the Lord; for I, the Lord, am thy God.
</p>
<p>
  48 And again, verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph, that whatsoever you
  give on earth, and to whomsoever you give any one on earth, by my word and
  according to my law, it shall be visited with blessings and not cursings, and
  with my power, saith the Lord, and shall be without condemnation on earth and
  in heaven.
</p>
<p>
  49 For I am the Lord thy God, and will be with thee even unto the end of the
  world, and through all eternity; for verily I seal upon you your exaltation,
  and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father, with Abraham your
  father.
</p>
<p>
  50 Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive all your sins; I have
  seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which I have told you. Go,
  therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as I accepted the offering of
  Abraham of his son Isaac.
</p>
<p>
  51 Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give unto mine handmaid, Emma
  Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay herself and
  partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did it,
  saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require
  an offering at your hand, by covenant and sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
  52 And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given
  unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who
  are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord
  God.
</p>
<p>
  53 For I am the Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my
  servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things; for he hath been
  faithful over a few things, and from henceforth I will strengthen him.
</p>
<p>
  54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my
  servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment
  she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will
  destroy her if she abide not in my law.
</p>
<p>
  55 But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do
  all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply
  him and give unto him an hundred-fold in this world, of fathers and mothers,
  brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of
  eternal lives in the eternal worlds.
</p>
<p>
  56 And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his
  trespasses; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has
  trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her, and multiply
  her, and make her heart to rejoice.
</p>
<p>
  57 And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his
  hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I
  am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and lo, I am with him,
  as I was with Abraham, thy father, even unto his exaltation and glory.
</p>
<p>
  58 Now, as touching the law of the priesthood, there are many things
  pertaining thereunto.
</p>
<p>
  59 Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron, by mine own voice,
  and by the voice of him that sent me, and I have endowed him with the keys of
  the power of this priesthood, if he do anything in my name, and according to
  my law and by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him.
</p>
<p>
  60 Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph; for I will justify him;
  for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands for his
  transgressions, saith the Lord your God.
</p>
<p>
  61 And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood&#x2014;if any man
  espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her
  consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to
  no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are
  given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto
  him and to no one else.
</p>
<p>
  62 And if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit
  adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore is he
  justified.
</p>
<p>
  63 But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be
  with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they
  are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my
  commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the
  foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that
  they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued,
  that he may be glorified.
</p>
<p>
  64 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who
  holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my
  priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and
  administer unto him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I
  will destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and
  abide in my law.
</p>
<p>
  65 Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him
  to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him,
  because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word; and
  she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who
  administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to
  take Hagar to wife.
</p>
<p>
  66 And now, as pertaining to this law, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will
  reveal more unto you, hereafter; therefore, let this suffice for the present.
  Behold, I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.
</p>
