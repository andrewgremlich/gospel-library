<p>
  1 Verily, verily, I say unto you my servant Frederick&#xA0;G. Williams: Listen
  to the voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God, and
  hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even to be a high priest in
  my church, and a counselor unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.;
</p>
<p>
  2 Unto whom I have given the keys of the kingdom, which belong always unto the
  Presidency of the High Priesthood:
</p>
<p>
  3 Therefore, verily I acknowledge him and will bless him, and also thee,
  inasmuch as thou art faithful in counsel, in the office which I have appointed
  unto you, in prayer always, vocally and in thy heart, in public and in
  private, also in thy ministry in proclaiming the gospel in the land of the
  living, and among thy brethren.
</p>
<p>
  4 And in doing these things thou wilt do the greatest good unto thy fellow
  beings, and wilt promote the glory of him who is your Lord.
</p>
<p>
  5 Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you;
  succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble
  knees.
</p>
<p>
  6 And if thou art faithful unto the end thou shalt have a crown of
  immortality, and eternal life in the mansions which I have prepared in the
  house of my Father.
</p>
<p>
  7 Behold, and lo, these are the words of Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ.
  Amen.
</p>
