<p>
  1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, in addition to the laws of the church
  concerning women and children, those who belong to the church, who have lost
  their husbands or fathers:
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  2 Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their
  husbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have
  fellowship in the church.
</p>
<p>
  3 And if they are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church;
  yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.
</p>
<p>
  4 All children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they
  are of age.
</p>
<p>
  5 And after that, they have claim upon the church, or in other words upon the
  Lord&#x2019;s storehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them
  inheritances.
</p>
<p>
  6 And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and
  widows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor. Amen.
</p>
