<p>
  1 Dear and well-beloved brother, Brigham Young, verily thus saith the Lord
  unto you: My servant Brigham, it is no more required at your hand to leave
  your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me.
</p>
<p>2 I have seen your labor and toil in journeyings for my name.</p>
<p>
  3 I therefore command you to send my word abroad, and take especial care of
  your family from this time, henceforth and forever. Amen.
</p>
