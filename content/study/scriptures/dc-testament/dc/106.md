<p>
  1 It is my will that my servant Warren&#xA0;A. Cowdery should be appointed and
  ordained a presiding high priest over my church, in the land of Freedom and
  the regions round about;
</p>
<p>
  2 And should preach my everlasting gospel, and lift up his voice and warn the
  people, not only in his own place, but in the adjoining counties;
</p>
<p>
  3 And devote his whole time to this high and holy calling, which I now give
  unto him, seeking diligently the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and
  all things necessary shall be added thereunto; for the laborer is worthy of
  his hire.
</p>
<p>
  4 And again, verily I say unto you, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and
  it overtaketh the world as a thief in the night&#x2014;
</p>
<p>
  5 Therefore, gird up your loins, that you may be the children of light, and
  that day shall not overtake you as a thief.
</p>
<p>
  6 And again, verily I say unto you, there was joy in heaven when my servant
  Warren bowed to my scepter, and separated himself from the crafts of men;
</p>
<p>
  7 Therefore, blessed is my servant Warren, for I will have mercy on him; and,
  notwithstanding the vanity of his heart, I will lift him up inasmuch as he
  will humble himself before me.
</p>
<p>
  8 And I will give him grace and assurance wherewith he may stand; and if he
  continue to be a faithful witness and a light unto the church I have prepared
  a crown for him in the mansions of my Father. Even so. Amen.
