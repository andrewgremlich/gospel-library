<p>
  1 Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou
  shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them by
  the Comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given.
</p>
<p>
  2 But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, no one shall be appointed to
  receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant
  Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.
</p>
<p>
  3 And thou shalt be obedient unto the things which I shall give unto him, even
  as Aaron, to declare faithfully the commandments and the revelations, with
  power and authority unto the church.
</p>
<p>
  4 And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter to speak or teach, or at
  all times by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it.
</p>
<p>5 But thou shalt not write by way of commandment, but by wisdom;</p>
<p>
  6 And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the
  church;
</p>
<p>
  7 For I have given him the keys of the mysteries, and the revelations which
  are sealed, until I shall appoint unto them another in his stead.
</p>
<p>
  8 And now, behold, I say unto you that you shall go unto the Lamanites and
  preach my gospel unto them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou
  shalt cause my church to be established among them; and thou shalt have
  revelations, but write them not by way of commandment.
</p>
<p>
  9 And now, behold, I say unto you that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth
  where the city Zion shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter. Behold, I
  say unto you that it shall be on the borders by the Lamanites.
</p>
<p>
  10 Thou shalt not leave this place until after the conference; and my servant
  Joseph shall be appointed to preside over the conference by the voice of it,
  and what he saith to thee thou shalt tell.
</p>
<p>
  11 And again, thou shalt take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee
  alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone
  are not of me and that Satan deceiveth him;
</p>
<p>
  12 For, behold, these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall
  anything be appointed unto any of this church contrary to the church
  covenants.
</p>
<p>
  13 For all things must be done in order, and by common consent in the church,
  by the prayer of faith.
</p>
<p>
  14 And thou shalt assist to settle all these things, according to the
  covenants of the church, before thou shalt take thy journey among the
  Lamanites.
</p>
<p>
  15 And it shall be given thee from the time thou shalt go, until the time thou
  shalt return, what thou shalt do.
</p>
<p>
  16 And thou must open thy mouth at all times, declaring my gospel with the
  sound of rejoicing. Amen.
</p>
