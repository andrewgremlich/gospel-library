<p>
  1 Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the
  prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  2 And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the
  fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.
</p>
<p>
  3 If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.
