<p>
  1 Behold, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant James Covel was
  right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word.
</p>
<p>
  2 And he received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him;
  and the fear of persecution and the cares of the world caused him to reject
  the word.
</p>
<p>
  3 Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as
  seemeth me good. Amen.
</p>
