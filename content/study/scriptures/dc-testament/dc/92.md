<p>
  1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, I give unto the united order, organized
  agreeable to the commandment previously given, a revelation and commandment
  concerning my servant Frederick&#xA0;G. Williams, that ye shall receive him
  into the order. What I say unto one I say unto all.
</p>
<p>
  2 And again, I say unto you my servant Frederick&#xA0;G. Williams, you shall
  be a lively member in this order; and inasmuch as you are faithful in keeping
  all former commandments you shall be blessed forever. Amen.
