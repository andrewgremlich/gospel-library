<p>
  1 And again, verily I say unto you, my friends, a commandment I give unto you,
  that ye shall commence a work of laying out and preparing a beginning and
  foundation of the city of the stake of Zion, here in the land of Kirtland,
  beginning at my house.
</p>
<p>
  2 And behold, it must be done according to the pattern which I have given unto
  you.
</p>
<p>
  3 And let the first lot on the south be consecrated unto me for the building
  of a house for the presidency, for the work of the presidency, in obtaining
  revelations; and for the work of the ministry of the presidency, in all things
  pertaining to the church and kingdom.
</p>
<p>
  4 Verily I say unto you, that it shall be built fifty-five by sixty-five feet
  in the width thereof and in the length thereof, in the inner court.
</p>
<p>
  5 And there shall be a lower court and a higher court, according to the
  pattern which shall be given unto you hereafter.
</p>
<p>
  6 And it shall be dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof,
  according to the order of the priesthood, according to the pattern which shall
  be given unto you hereafter.
</p>
<p>
  7 And it shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord for the work of the
  presidency.
</p>
<p>
  8 And ye shall not suffer any unclean thing to come in unto it; and my glory
  shall be there, and my presence shall be there.
</p>
<p>
  9 But if there shall come into it any unclean thing, my glory shall not be
  there; and my presence shall not come into it.
</p>
<p>
  10 And again, verily I say unto you, the second lot on the south shall be
  dedicated unto me for the building of a house unto me, for the work of the
  printing of the translation of my scriptures, and all things whatsoever I
  shall command you.
</p>
<p>
  11 And it shall be fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and the
  length thereof, in the inner court; and there shall be a lower and a higher
  court.
</p>
<p>
  12 And this house shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation
  thereof, for the work of the printing, in all things whatsoever I shall
  command you, to be holy, undefiled, according to the pattern in all things as
  it shall be given unto you.
</p>
<p>
  13 And on the third lot shall my servant Hyrum Smith receive his inheritance.
</p>
<p>
  14 And on the first and second lots on the north shall my servants Reynolds
  Cahoon and Jared Carter receive their inheritances&#x2014;
</p>
<p>
  15 That they may do the work which I have appointed unto them, to be a
  committee to build mine houses, according to the commandment, which I, the
  Lord God, have given unto you.
</p>
<p>
  16 These two houses are not to be built until I give unto you a commandment
  concerning them.
</p>
<p>17 And now I give unto you no more at this time. Amen.</p>
