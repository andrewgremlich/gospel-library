<p>
  1 Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, and I will speak unto my servant
  Edward Partridge, and give unto him directions; for it must needs be that he
  receive directions how to organize this people.
</p>
<p>
  2 For it must needs be that they be organized according to my laws; if
  otherwise, they will be cut off.
</p>
<p>
  3 Wherefore, let my servant Edward Partridge, and those whom he has chosen, in
  whom I am well pleased, appoint unto this people their portions, every man
  equal according to his family, according to his circumstances and his wants
  and needs.
</p>
<p>
  4 And let my servant Edward Partridge, when he shall appoint a man his
  portion, give unto him a writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that
  he shall hold it, even this right and this inheritance in the church, until he
  transgresses and is not accounted worthy by the voice of the church, according
  to the laws and covenants of the church, to belong to the church.
</p>
<p>
  5 And if he shall transgress and is not accounted worthy to belong to the
  church, he shall not have power to claim that portion which he has consecrated
  unto the bishop for the poor and needy of my church; therefore, he shall not
  retain the gift, but shall only have claim on that portion that is deeded unto
  him.
</p>
<p>
  6 And thus all things shall be made sure, according to the laws of the land.
</p>
<p>
  7 And let that which belongs to this people be appointed unto this people.
</p>
<p>
  8 And the money which is left unto this people&#x2014;let there be an agent
  appointed unto this people, to take the money to provide food and raiment,
  according to the wants of this people.
</p>
<p>
  9 And let every man deal honestly, and be alike among this people, and receive
  alike, that ye may be one, even as I have commanded you.
</p>
<p>
  10 And let that which belongeth to this people not be taken and given unto
  that of another church.
</p>
<p>
  11 Wherefore, if another church would receive money of this church, let them
  pay unto this church again according as they shall agree;
</p>
<p>
  12 And this shall be done through the bishop or the agent, which shall be
  appointed by the voice of the church.
</p>
<p>
  13 And again, let the bishop appoint a storehouse unto this church; and let
  all things both in money and in meat, which are more than is needful for the
  wants of this people, be kept in the hands of the bishop.
</p>
<p>
  14 And let him also reserve unto himself for his own wants, and for the wants
  of his family, as he shall be employed in doing this business.
</p>
<p>
  15 And thus I grant unto this people a privilege of organizing themselves
  according to my laws.
</p>
<p>
  16 And I consecrate unto them this land for a little season, until I, the
  Lord, shall provide for them otherwise, and command them to go hence;
</p>
<p>
  17 And the hour and the day is not given unto them, wherefore let them act
  upon this land as for years, and this shall turn unto them for their good.
</p>
<p>
  18 Behold, this shall be an example unto my servant Edward Partridge, in other
  places, in all churches.
</p>
<p>
  19 And whoso is found a faithful, a just, and a wise steward shall enter into
  the joy of his Lord, and shall inherit eternal life.
</p>
<p>
  20 Verily, I say unto you, I am Jesus Christ, who cometh quickly, in an hour
  you think not. Even so. Amen.
</p>
