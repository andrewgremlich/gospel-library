<p>
  The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It
  is a record of God&#x2019;s dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas
  and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.
</p>
<p>
  The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and
  revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a
  prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great
  civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600&#xA0;B.C. and afterward
  separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other
  came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel.
  This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were
  destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the
  American Indians.
</p>
<p>
  The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of
  the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after His resurrection. It puts
  forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells
  men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the
  life to come.
</p>
<p>
  After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son
  Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the Hill
  Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected
  being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the
  ancient record and its destined translation into the English language.
</p>
<p>
  In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them
  by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as
  a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God
  and that all who will come unto Him and obey the laws and ordinances of His
  gospel may be saved.
</p>
<p>
  Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: &#x201C;I told the
  brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth,
  and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding
  by its precepts, than by any other book.&#x201D;
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the
  gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and
  divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included
  herewith as &#x201C;The Testimony of Three Witnesses&#x201D; and &#x201C;The
  Testimony of Eight Witnesses.&#x201D;
</p>
<p>
  We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their
  hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in
  the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask
  in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the
  Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3&#x2013;5.)
</p>
<p>
  Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come to know
  by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph
  Smith is His revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of
  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord&#x2019;s kingdom once again
  established on the earth, preparatory to the Second Coming of the Messiah.
