  The Book of Mormon is a sacred record of peoples in ancient America and was
  engraved upon metal plates. Sources from which this record was compiled
  include the following:

    <p>
      The Plates of Nephi, which were of two kinds: the small plates and the
      large plates. The former were more particularly devoted to spiritual
      matters and the ministry and teachings of the prophets, while the latter
      were occupied mostly by a secular history of the peoples concerned
      (1&#xA0;Nephi 9:2&#x2013;4). From the time of Mosiah, however, the large
      plates also included items of major spiritual importance.

      The Plates of Mormon, which consist of an abridgment by Mormon from the
      large plates of Nephi, with many commentaries. These plates also contained
      a continuation of the history by Mormon and additions by his son Moroni.

      The Plates of Ether, which present a history of the Jaredites. This record
      was abridged by Moroni, who inserted comments of his own and incorporated
      the record with the general history under the title &#x201C;Book of
      Ether.&#x201D;

      The Plates of Brass brought by the people of Lehi from Jerusalem in
      600&#xA0;B.C. These contained &#x201C;the five books of Moses, &#x2026;
      and also a record of the Jews from the beginning, &#x2026; down to the
      commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah; and also the
      prophecies of the holy prophets&#x201D; (1&#xA0;Nephi 5:11&#x2013;13).
      Many quotations from these plates, citing Isaiah and other biblical and
      nonbiblical prophets, appear in the Book of Mormon.

  The Book of Mormon comprises fifteen main parts or divisions, known, with one
  exception, as books, usually designated by the name of their principal author.
  The first portion (the first six books, ending with Omni) is a translation
  from the small plates of Nephi. Between the books of Omni and Mosiah is an
  insert called the Words of Mormon. This insert connects the record engraved on
  the small plates with Mormon&#x2019;s abridgment of the large plates.
</p>
<p>
  The longest portion, from Mosiah through Mormon chapter 7, is a translation of
  Mormon&#x2019;s abridgment of the large plates of Nephi. The concluding
  portion, from Mormon chapter 8 to the end of the volume, was engraved by
  Mormon&#x2019;s son Moroni, who, after finishing the record of his
  father&#x2019;s life, made an abridgment of the Jaredite record (as the book
  of Ether) and later added the parts known as the book of Moroni.
</p>
<p>
  In or about the year A.D.&#xA0;421, Moroni, the last of the Nephite
  prophet-historians, sealed the sacred record and hid it up unto the Lord, to
  be brought forth in the latter days, as predicted by the voice of God through
  His ancient prophets. In A.D.&#xA0;1823, this same Moroni, then a resurrected
  personage, visited the Prophet Joseph Smith and subsequently delivered the
  engraved plates to him.

  About this edition: The original title page, immediately preceding the
  contents page, is taken from the plates and is part of the sacred text.
  Introductions in a non-italic typeface, such as in 1&#xA0;Nephi and
  immediately preceding Mosiah chapter 9, are also part of the sacred text.
  Introductions in italics, such as in chapter headings, are not original to the
  text but are study helps included for convenience in reading.
</p>
<p>
  Some minor errors in the text have been perpetuated in past editions of the
  Book of Mormon. This edition contains corrections that seem appropriate to
  bring the material into conformity with prepublication manuscripts and early
  editions edited by the Prophet Joseph Smith.
