  Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also
  of the Lamanites&#x2014;Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the
  house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile&#x2014;Written by way of
  commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of
  revelation&#x2014;Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they
  might not be destroyed&#x2014;To come forth by the gift and power of God unto
  the interpretation thereof&#x2014;Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up
  unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile&#x2014;The
  interpretation thereof by the gift of God.

<p>
  An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the
  people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the
  language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to
  heaven&#x2014;Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what
  great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the
  covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever&#x2014;And also to
  the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal
  God, manifesting himself unto all nations&#x2014;And now, if there are faults
  they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that
  ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.
