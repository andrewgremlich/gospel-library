<p>
  1 And in that day thou shalt say: O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast
  angry with me thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.
</p>
<p>
  2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord
  Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also has become my salvation.
</p>
<p>3 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</p>
<p>
  4 And in that day shall ye say: Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare
  his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.
</p>
<p>
  5 Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all
  the earth.
</p>
<p>
  6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of
  Israel in the midst of thee.
