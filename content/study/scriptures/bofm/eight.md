<p>
  Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this
  work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has
  shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance
  of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did
  handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which
  has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we
  bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us,
  for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got
  the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to
  witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing
  witness of it.
