<p>
  1 The manner which the disciples, who were called the elders of the church,
  ordained priests and teachers&#x2014;
</p>
<p>
  2 After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ, they laid their
  hands upon them, and said:
</p>
<p>
  3 In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest (or if he be a
  teacher, I ordain you to be a teacher) to preach repentance and remission of
  sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end.
  Amen.
</p>
<p>
  4 And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers, according to the
  gifts and callings of God unto men; and they ordained them by the power of the
  Holy Ghost, which was in them.
