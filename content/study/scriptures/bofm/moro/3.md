1 The manner which the disciples, who were called the elders of the church, ordained priests and teachers—2 After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ, they laid their hands upon them, and said.

3 In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest (or if he be a teacher, I ordain you to be a teacher) to preach repentance and remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen.

4 And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers, according to the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they ordained them by the power of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.
