<p>
  1 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she
  find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her:
  then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and
  send her out of his house.
</p>
<p>
  2 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another
  man&#x2019;s wife.
</p>
<p>
  3 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and
  giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter
  husband die, which took her to be his wife;
</p>
<p>
  4 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his
  wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the Lord: and
  thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for
  an inheritance.
</p>
<p>
  5 &#xB6; When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither
  shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year,
  and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.
</p>
<p>
  6 &#xB6; No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he
  taketh a man&#x2019;s life to pledge.
</p>
<p>
  7 &#xB6; If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of
  Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall
  die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.
</p>
<p>
  8 &#xB6; Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and
  do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I
  commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.
</p>
<p>
  9 Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye
  were come forth out of Egypt.
</p>
<p>
  10 &#xB6; When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into
  his house to fetch his pledge.
</p>
<p>
  11 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out
  the pledge abroad unto thee.
</p>
<p>12 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:</p>
<p>
  13 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth
  down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be
  righteousness unto thee before the Lord thy God.
</p>
<p>
  14 &#xB6; Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy,
  whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within
  thy gates:
</p>
<p>
  15 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon
  it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee
  unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee.
</p>
<p>
  16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the
  children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for
  his own sin.
</p>
<p>
  17 &#xB6; Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the
  fatherless; nor take a widow&#x2019;s raiment to pledge:
</p>
<p>
  18 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the Lord thy
  God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
</p>
<p>
  19 &#xB6; When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a
  sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the
  stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the Lord thy God may
  bless thee in all the work of thine hands.
</p>
<p>
  20 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs
  again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
</p>
<p>
  21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it
  afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the
  widow.
</p>
<p>
  22 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt:
  therefore I command thee to do this thing.
</p>
