<p>
  1 For Zion&#x2019;s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem&#x2019;s
  sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness,
  and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.
</p>
<p>
  2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and
  thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.
</p>
<p>
  3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal
  diadem in the hand of thy God.
</p>
<p>
  4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be
  termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for
  the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
</p>
<p>
  5 &#xB6; For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee:
  and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over
  thee.
</p>
<p>
  6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold
  their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence,
</p>
<p>
  7 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise
  in the earth.
</p>
<p>
  8 The Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,
  Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons
  of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:
</p>
<p>
  9 But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the Lord; and they
  that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
</p>
<p>
  10 &#xB6; Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people;
  cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for
  the people.
</p>
<p>
  11 Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the
  daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with
  him, and his work before him.
</p>
<p>
  12 And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord: and
  thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
</p>
