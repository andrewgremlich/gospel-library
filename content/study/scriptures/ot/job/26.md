<p>1 But Job answered and said,</p>
<p>
  2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that
  hath no strength?
</p>
<p>
  3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou
  plentifully declared the thing as it is?
</p>
<p>4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</p>
<p>
  5 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
</p>
<p>6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</p>
<p>
  7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon
  nothing.
</p>
<p>
  8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent
  under them.
</p>
<p>
  9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
</p>
<p>
  10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to
  an end.
</p>
<p>11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</p>
<p>
  12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth
  through the proud.
</p>
<p>
  13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the
  crooked serpent.
</p>
<p>
  14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him?
  but the thunder of his power who can understand?
</p>
