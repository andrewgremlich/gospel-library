<p>1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</p>
<p>
  2 For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the
  Almighty from on high?
</p>
<p>
  3 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of
  iniquity?
</p>
<p>4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</p>
<p>5 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;</p>
<p>6 Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.</p>
<p>
  7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine
  eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
</p>
<p>
  8 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
</p>
<p>
  9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my
  neighbour&#x2019;s door;
</p>
<p>10 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</p>
<p>
  11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the
  judges.
</p>
<p>
  12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine
  increase.
</p>
<p>
  13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they
  contended with me;
</p>
<p>
  14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I
  answer him?
</p>
<p>
  15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in
  the womb?
</p>
<p>
  16 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of
  the widow to fail;
</p>
<p>
  17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten
  thereof;
</p>
<p>
  18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have
  guided her from my mother&#x2019;s womb;)
</p>
<p>
  19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without
  covering;
</p>
<p>
  20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece
  of my sheep;
</p>
<p>
  21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in
  the gate:
</p>
<p>
  22 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from
  the bone.
</p>
<p>
  23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness
  I could not endure.
</p>
<p>
  24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my
  confidence;
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  25 If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten
  much;
</p>
<p>26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;</p>
<p>
  27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
</p>
<p>
  28 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have
  denied the God that is above.
</p>
<p>
  29 If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself
  when evil found him:
</p>
<p>
  30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
</p>
<p>
  31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we
  cannot be satisfied.
</p>
<p>
  32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the
  traveller.
</p>
<p>
  33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my
  bosom:
</p>
<p>
  34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me,
  that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
</p>
<p>
  35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would
  answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
</p>
<p>36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.</p>
<p>
  37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go
  near unto him.
</p>
<p>
  38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
</p>
<p>
  39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners
  thereof to lose their life:
</p>
<p>
  40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words
  of Job are ended.
