<p>
  1 O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine
  iniquity.
</p>
<p>
  2 Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all
  iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.
</p>
<p>
  3 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say
  any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless
  findeth mercy.
</p>
<p>
  4 &#xB6; I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine
  anger is turned away from him.
</p>
<p>
  5 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth
  his roots as Lebanon.
</p>
<p>
  6 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and
  his smell as Lebanon.
</p>
<p>
  7 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the
  corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
</p>
<p>
  8 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him,
  and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.
</p>
<p>
  9 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall
  know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in
  them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
</p>
