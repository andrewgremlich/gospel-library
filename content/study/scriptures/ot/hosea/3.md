<p>
  1 Then said the Lord unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet
  an adulteress, according to the love of the Lord toward the children of
  Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.
</p>
<p>
  2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of
  barley, and an half homer of barley:
</p>
<p>
  3 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play
  the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.
</p>
<p>
  4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without
  a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod,
  and without teraphim:
</p>
<p>
  5 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God,
  and David their king; and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter
  days.
</p>
