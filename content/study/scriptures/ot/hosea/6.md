<p>
  1 Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal
  us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
</p>
<p>
  2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and
  we shall live in his sight.
</p>
<p>
  3 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: his going forth is
  prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter
  and former rain unto the earth.
</p>
<p>
  4 &#xB6; O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto
  thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth
  away.
</p>
<p>
  5 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words
  of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
</p>
<p>
  6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than
  burnt offerings.
</p>
<p>
  7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt
  treacherously against me.
</p>
<p>
  8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.
</p>
<p>
  9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in
  the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.
</p>
<p>
  10 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom
  of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
</p>
<p>
  11 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the
  captivity of my people.
