<p>1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</p>
<p>
  2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the
  paths.
</p>
<p>
  3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the
  doors.
</p>
<p>4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.</p>
<p>
  5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding
  heart.
</p>
<p>
  6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall
  be right things.
</p>
<p>
  7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
</p>
<p>
  8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or
  perverse in them.
</p>
<p>
  9 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find
  knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice
  gold.
</p>
<p>
  11 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired
  are not to be compared to it.
</p>
<p>
  12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil
  way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
</p>
<p>
  14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
</p>
<p>15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p>16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p>17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p>18 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.</p>
<p>
  19 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than
  choice silver.
</p>
<p>
  20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
</p>
<p>
  21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill
  their treasures.
</p>
<p>
  22 The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
</p>
<p>
  23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
</p>
<p>
  24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no
  fountains abounding with water.
</p>
<p>
  25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
</p>
<p>
  26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest
  part of the dust of the world.
</p>
<p>
  27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the
  face of the depth:
</p>
<p>
  28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of
  the deep:
</p>
<p>
  29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his
  commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
</p>
<p>
  30 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight,
  rejoicing always before him;
</p>
<p>
  31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the
  sons of men.
</p>
<p>
  32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that
  keep my ways.
</p>
<p>33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p>
  34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at
  the posts of my doors.
</p>
<p>
  35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me
  love death.
