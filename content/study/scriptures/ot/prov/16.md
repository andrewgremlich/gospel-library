<p>
  1 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from
  the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the
  spirits.
</p>
<p>3 Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established.</p>
<p>
  4 The Lord hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day
  of evil.
</p>
<p>
  5 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord: though hand
  join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.
</p>
<p>
  6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the Lord men
  depart from evil.
</p>
<p>
  7 When a man&#x2019;s ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be
  at peace with him.
</p>
<p>
  8 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.
</p>
<p>
  9 A man&#x2019;s heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps.
</p>
<p>
  10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not
  in judgment.
</p>
<p>
  11 A just weight and balance are the Lord&#x2019;s: all the weights of the bag
  are his work.
</p>
<p>
  12 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is
  established by righteousness.
</p>
<p>
  13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh
  right.
</p>
<p>
  14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify
  it.
</p>
<p>
  15 In the light of the king&#x2019;s countenance is life; and his favour is as
  a cloud of the latter rain.
</p>
<p>
  16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding
  rather to be chosen than silver!
</p>
<p>
  17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way
  preserveth his soul.
</p>
<p>18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
<p>
  19 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the
  spoil with the proud.
</p>
<p>
  20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the
  Lord, happy is he.
</p>
<p>
  21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips
  increaseth learning.
</p>
<p>
  22 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the
  instruction of fools is folly.
</p>
<p>
  23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.
</p>
<p>
  24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the
  bones.
</p>
<p>
  25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the
  ways of death.
</p>
<p>
  26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.
</p>
<p>
  27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.
</p>
<p>28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.</p>
<p>
  29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is
  not good.
</p>
<p>
  30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth
  evil to pass.
</p>
<p>
  31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of
  righteousness.
</p>
<p>
  32 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his
  spirit than he that taketh a city.
</p>
<p>
  33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the
  Lord.
