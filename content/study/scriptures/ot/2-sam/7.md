<p>
  1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given
  him rest round about from all his enemies;
</p>
<p>
  2 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of
  cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
</p>
<p>
  3 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the Lord
  is with thee.
</p>
<p>
  4 &#xB6; And it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came unto
  Nathan, saying,
</p>
<p>
  5 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build me an
  house for me to dwell in?
</p>
<p>
  6 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the
  children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent
  and in a tabernacle.
</p>
<p>
  7 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel
  spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my
  people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?
</p>
<p>
  8 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord
  of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be
  ruler over my people, over Israel:
</p>
<p>
  9 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine
  enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name
  of the great men that are in the earth.
</p>
<p>
  10 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
  that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall
  the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,
</p>
<p>
  11 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel,
  and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the Lord telleth
  thee that he will make thee an house.
</p>
<p>
  12 &#xB6; And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
  fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy
  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
</p>
<p>
  13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his
  kingdom for ever.
</p>
<p>
  14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will
  chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
</p>
<p>
  15 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I
  put away before thee.
</p>
<p>
  16 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee:
  thy throne shall be established for ever.
</p>
<p>
  17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did
  Nathan speak unto David.
</p>
<p>
  18 &#xB6; Then went king David in, and sat before the Lord, and he said, Who
  am I, O Lord God? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
</p>
<p>
  19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou hast
  spoken also of thy servant&#x2019;s house for a great while to come. And is
  this the manner of man, O Lord God?
</p>
<p>
  20 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord God, knowest thy
  servant.
</p>
<p>
  21 For thy word&#x2019;s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
  done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
</p>
<p>
  22 Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God: for there is none like thee, neither
  is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our
  ears.
</p>
<p>
  23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom
  God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do
  for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou
  redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
</p>
<p>
  24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto
  thee for ever: and thou, Lord, art become their God.
</p>
<p>
  25 And now, O Lord God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant,
  and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.
</p>
<p>
  26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The Lord of hosts is the
  God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before
  thee.
</p>
<p>
  27 For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant,
  saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his
  heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
</p>
<p>
  28 And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou
  hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
</p>
<p>
  29 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it
  may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it: and
  with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
