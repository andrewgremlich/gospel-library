  1 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the
  sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps,
  with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to
  their service was:
</p>
<p>
  2 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the
  sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the
  order of the king.
</p>
<p>
  3 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah,
  Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who
  prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  4 Of Heman: the sons of Heman; Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and
  Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer,

</p>
<p>
  5 All these were the sons of Heman the king&#x2019;s seer in the words of God,
  to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
</p>
<p>
  6 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the
  Lord, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of
  God, according to the king&#x2019;s order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

  7 So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs
  of the Lord, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

  great, the teacher as the scholar.
