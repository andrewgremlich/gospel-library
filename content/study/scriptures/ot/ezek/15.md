<p>1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>
  2 Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which
  is among the trees of the forest?
</p>
<p>
  3 Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to
  hang any vessel thereon?
</p>
<p>
  4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends
  of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?
</p>
<p>
  5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it
  be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?
</p>
<p>
  6 &#xB6; Therefore thus saith the Lord God; As the vine tree among the trees
  of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the
  inhabitants of Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
  7 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and
  another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I
  set my face against them.
</p>
<p>
  8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass,
  saith the Lord God.
</p>
