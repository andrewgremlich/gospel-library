  1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when
  he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth
  year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
</p>
<p>2 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;</p>
<p>
  3 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow; I
  fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
</p>
<p>
  4 &#xB6; Thus shalt thou say unto him, The Lord saith thus; Behold, that which
  I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up,
  even this whole land.
</p>
<p>
  5 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I
  will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but thy life will I give unto
  thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.
