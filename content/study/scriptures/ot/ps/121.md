<p>1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</p>
<p>2 My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>
  3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not
  slumber.
</p>
<p>4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
<p>5 The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.</p>
<p>6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.</p>
<p>7 The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.</p>
<p>
  8 The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time
  forth, and even for evermore.
</p>
