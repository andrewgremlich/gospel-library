<p>
  1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they
  have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
</p>
<p>
  2 The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there
  were any that did understand, and seek God.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none
  that doeth good, no, not one.
</p>
<p>
  4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they
  eat bread, and call not upon the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  5 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the
  righteous.
</p>
<p>6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge.</p>
<p>
  7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the Lord
  bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel
  shall be glad.
