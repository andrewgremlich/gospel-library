<p>
  1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament
  of his power.
</p>
<p>
  2 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent
  greatness.
</p>
<p>
  3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and
  harp.
</p>
<p>
  4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments
  and organs.
</p>
<p>
  5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
</p>
<p>6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.</p>
