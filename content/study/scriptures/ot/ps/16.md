<p>1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</p>
<p>
  2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness
  extendeth not to thee;
</p>
<p>
  3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is
  all my delight.
</p>
<p>
  4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink
  offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
</p>
<p>
  5 The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest
  my lot.
</p>
<p>
  6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
  heritage.
</p>
<p>
  7 I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me
  in the night seasons.
</p>
<p>
  8 I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I
  shall not be moved.
</p>
<p>
  9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest
  in hope.
</p>
<p>
  10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine
  Holy One to see corruption.
</p>
<p>
  11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at
  thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
</p>
