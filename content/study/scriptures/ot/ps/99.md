<p>
  1 The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims;
  let the earth be moved.
</p>
<p>2 The Lord is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.</p>
<p>3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.</p>
<p>
  4 The king&#x2019;s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity,
  thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
</p>
<p>
  5 Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
</p>
<p>
  6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his
  name; they called upon the Lord, and he answered them.
</p>
<p>
  7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the
  ordinance that he gave them.
</p>
<p>
  8 Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them,
  though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
</p>
<p>
  9 Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the Lord our God
  is holy.
</p>
