<p>1 Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength.</p>
<p>
  2 Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the
  beauty of holiness.
</p>
<p>
  3 The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the
  Lord is upon many waters.
</p>
<p>
  4 The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.
</p>
<p>
  5 The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars
  of Lebanon.
</p>

<p>
  6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young
  unicorn.
</p>
<p>7 The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire.</p>
<p>
  8 The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the
  wilderness of Kadesh.
</p>
<p>
  9 The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the
  forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
</p>
<p>10 The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever.</p>
<p>
  11 The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people
  with peace.
</p>
