<p>
  1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O
  God.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear
  before God?
</p>
<p>
  3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto
  me, Where is thy God?
</p>
<p>
  4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with
  the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and
  praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
</p>
<p>
  5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope
  thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.
</p>
<p>
  6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee
  from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.
</p>
<p>
  7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and
  thy billows are gone over me.
</p>
<p>
  8 Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the
  night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.
</p>
<p>
  9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning
  because of the oppression of the enemy?
</p>
<p>
  10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily
  unto me, Where is thy God?
</p>
<p>
  11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me?
  hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my
  countenance, and my God.
</p>
