<p>
  1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time
  of trouble.
</p>
<p>
  2 The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon
  the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
</p>
<p>
  3 The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all
  his bed in his sickness.
</p>
<p>
  4 I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against
  thee.
</p>
<p>5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?</p>
<p>
  6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity
  to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
</p>
<p>
  7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my
  hurt.
</p>
<p>
  8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he
  shall rise up no more.
</p>
<p>
  9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread,
  hath lifted up his heel against me.
</p>
<p>
  10 But thou, O Lord, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite
  them.
</p>
<p>
  11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph
  over me.
</p>
<p>
  12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before
  thy face for ever.
</p>
<p>
  13 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting.
  Amen, and Amen.
</p>
