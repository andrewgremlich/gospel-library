<p>
  1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the
  heights.
</p>
<p>2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.</p>
<p>3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.</p>
<p>
  4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.
</p>
<p>
  5 Let them praise the name of the Lord: for he commanded, and they were
  created.
</p>
<p>
  6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which
  shall not pass.
</p>
<p>7 Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:</p>
<p>8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:</p>
<p>9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:</p>
<p>10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:</p>
<p>
  11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
</p>
<p>12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:</p>
<p>
  13 Let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name alone is excellent; his
  glory is above the earth and heaven.
</p>
<p>
  14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even
  of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.
