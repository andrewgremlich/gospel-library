<p>
  1 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except
  the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
</p>
<p>
  2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of
  sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
</p>
<p>
  3 Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his
  reward.
</p>
<p>
  4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.
</p>
<p>
  5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be
  ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
</p>
