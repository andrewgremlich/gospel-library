<p>
  1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
</p>
<p>
  2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?
  Selah.
</p>
<p>3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.</p>
<p>4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p>
  5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all
  the foundations of the earth are out of course.
</p>
<p>6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</p>
<p>7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>
<p>8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>
