<p>
  1 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up
  against me.
</p>
<p>
  2 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  3 But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine
  head.
</p>
<p>
  4 I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill.
  Selah.
</p>
<p>5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me.</p>
<p>
  6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves
  against me round about.
</p>
<p>
  7 Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies
  upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
</p>
<p>
  8 Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
</p>
