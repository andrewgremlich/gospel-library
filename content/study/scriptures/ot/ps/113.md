<p>
  1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of
  the Lord.
</p>
<p>2 Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore.</p>
<p>
  3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord&#x2019;s
  name is to be praised.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>4 The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.</p>
<p>5 Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,</p>
<p>
  6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the
  earth!
</p>
<p>
  7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the
  dunghill;
</p>
<p>8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.</p>
<p>
  9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of
  children. Praise ye the Lord.
