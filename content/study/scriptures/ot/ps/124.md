<p>1 If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say;</p>
<p>
  2 If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against
  us:
</p>
<p>
  3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against
  us:
</p>
<p>4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:</p>
<p>5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.</p>
<p>6 Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.</p>
<p>
  7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is
  broken, and we are escaped.
</p>
<p>8 Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>
