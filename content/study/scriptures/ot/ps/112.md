<p>
  1 Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that
  delighteth greatly in his commandments.
</p>
<p>
  2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be
  blessed.
</p>
<p>
  3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for
  ever.
</p>
<p>
  4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and
  full of compassion, and righteous.
</p>
<p>
  5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with
  discretion.
</p>
<p>
  6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting
  remembrance.
</p>
<p>
  7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the
  Lord.
</p>
<p>
  8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire
  upon his enemies.
</p>
<p>
  9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for
  ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
</p>
<p>
  10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and
  melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
</p>
