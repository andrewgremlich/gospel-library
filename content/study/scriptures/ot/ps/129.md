<p>1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:</p>
<p>
  2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not
  prevailed against me.
</p>
<p>3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.</p>
<p>4 The Lord is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.</p>
<p>5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.</p>
<p>
  6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it
  groweth up:
</p>
<p>
  7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his
  bosom.
</p>
<p>
  8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we
  bless you in the name of the Lord.
</p>
