<p>
  1 O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
</p>
<p>2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.</p>
<p>
  3 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing praises unto
  thee among the nations.
</p>
<p>
  4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
  clouds.
</p>
<p>
  5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the
  earth;
</p>
<p>
  6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
</p>
<p>
  7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and
  mete out the valley of Succoth.
</p>
<p>
  8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head;
  Judah is my lawgiver;
</p>
<p>
  9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I
  triumph.
</p>
<p>10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p>
  11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go
  forth with our hosts?
</p>
<p>12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
<p>
  13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our
  enemies.
</p>
