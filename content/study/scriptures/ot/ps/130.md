<p>1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.</p>
<p>
  2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my
  supplications.
</p>
<p>3 If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</p>
<p>4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</p>
<p>5 I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</p>
<p>
  6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I
  say, more than they that watch for the morning.
</p>
<p>
  7 Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him
  is plenteous redemption.
</p>
<p>8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p>
