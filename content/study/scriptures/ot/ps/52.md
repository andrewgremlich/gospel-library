<p>
  1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God
  endureth continually.
</p>
<p>2 Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</p>
<p>
  3 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak
  righteousness. Selah.
</p>
<p>4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.</p>
<p>
  5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck
  thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living.
  Selah.
</p>
<p>6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:</p>
<p>
  7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the
  abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
</p>
<p>
  8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy
  of God for ever and ever.
</p>
<p>
  9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on
  thy name; for it is good before thy saints.
</p>
