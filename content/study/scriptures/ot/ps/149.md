<p>
  1 Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise in the
  congregation of saints.
</p>
<p>
  2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful
  in their King.
</p>
<p>
  3 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with
  the timbrel and harp.
</p>
<p>
  4 For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with
  salvation.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.</p>
<p>
  6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their
  hand;
</p>
<p>7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;</p>
<p>8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;</p>
<p>
  9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints.
  Praise ye the Lord.
</p>
