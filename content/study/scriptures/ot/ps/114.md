<p>
  1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange
  language;
</p>
<p>2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.</p>
<p>3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.</p>
<p>4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.</p>
<p>
  5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast
  driven back?
</p>
<p>
  6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
</p>
<p>
  7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God
  of Jacob;
</p>
<p>
  8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of
  waters.
</p>
