<p>
  1 Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, in the
  assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
</p>
<p>
  2 The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure
  therein.
</p>
<p>
  3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for
  ever.
</p>
<p>
  4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the Lord is gracious and
  full of compassion.
</p>
<p>
  5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his
  covenant.
</p>
<p>
  6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the
  heritage of the heathen.
</p>
<p>
  7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are
  sure.
</p>
<p>
  8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
</p>
<p>
  9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever:
  holy and reverend is his name.
</p>
<p>
  10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have
  all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
</p>
