<p>
  1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have
  done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
</p>
<p>
  2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were
  any that did understand, that did seek God.
</p>
<p>
  3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is
  none that doeth good, no, not one.
</p>
<p>
  4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat
  bread: they have not called upon God.
</p>
<p>
  5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the
  bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because
  God hath despised them.
</p>
<p>
  6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth
  back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be
  glad.
</p>
