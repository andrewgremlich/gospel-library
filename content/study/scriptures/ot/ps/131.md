<p>
  1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise
  myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
</p>
<p>
  2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his
  mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
</p>
<p>3 Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and for ever.</p>
