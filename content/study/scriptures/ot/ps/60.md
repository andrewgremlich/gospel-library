<p>
  1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been
  displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
</p>
<p>
  2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches
  thereof; for it shaketh.
</p>
<p>
  3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine
  of astonishment.
</p>
<p>
  4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed
  because of the truth. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.
</p>
<p>
  6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and
  mete out the valley of Succoth.
</p>
<p>
  7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine
  head; Judah is my lawgiver;
</p>
<p>
  8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph
  thou because of me.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p>
  10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst
  not go out with our armies?
</p>
<p>11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
<p>
  12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our
  enemies.
</p>
