<p>
  1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us;
  Selah.
</p>
<p>
  2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
</p>
<p>3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.</p>
<p>
  4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people
  righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
</p>
<p>5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.</p>
<p>
  6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall
  bless us.
</p>
<p>7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.</p>
