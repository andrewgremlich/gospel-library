<p>
  1 The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob
  defend thee;
</p>
<p>2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;</p>
<p>3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.</p>
<p>4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.</p>
<p>
  5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up
  our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions.
</p>
<p>
  6 Now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy
  heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
</p>
<p>
  7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of
  the Lord our God.
</p>
<p>8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.</p>
<p>9 Save, Lord: let the king hear us when we call.</p>
