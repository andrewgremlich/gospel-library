<p>1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!</p>
<p>
  2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and
  my flesh crieth out for the living God.
</p>
<p>
  3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself,
  where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and
  my God.
</p>
<p>
  4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee.
  Selah.
</p>
<p>
  5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of
  them.
</p>
<p>
  6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth
  the pools.
</p>
<p>
  7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth
  before God.
</p>
<p>8 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.</p>
<p>9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.</p>
<p>
  10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a
  doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
</p>
<p>
  11 For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory:
  no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
</p>
<p>12 O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</p>
