<p>
  1 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine
  enemies thy footstool.
</p>
<p>
  2 The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the
  midst of thine enemies.
</p>
<p>
  3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of
  holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
</p>
<p>
  4 The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after
  the order of Melchizedek.
</p>
<p>
  5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his
  wrath.
</p>
<p>
  6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead
  bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
</p>
