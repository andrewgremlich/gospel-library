<p>
  1 They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed,
  but abideth for ever.
</p>
<p>
  2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his
  people from henceforth even for ever.
</p>
<p>
  3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest
  the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
</p>
<p>
  4 Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in
  their hearts.
</p>
<p>
  5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them
  forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
</p>
