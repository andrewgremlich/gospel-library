<p>1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.</p>
<p>
  2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be
  greatly moved.
</p>
<p>
  3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of
  you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
</p>
<p>
  4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in
  lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
</p>
<p>5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.</p>
<p>
  6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
</p>
<p>
  7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge,
  is in God.
</p>
<p>
  8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is
  a refuge for us. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be
  laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
</p>
<p>
  10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches
  increase, set not your heart upon them.
</p>
<p>
  11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto
  God.
</p>
<p>
  12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man
  according to his work.
</p>
