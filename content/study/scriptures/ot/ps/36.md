<p>
  1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear
  of God before his eyes.
</p>
<p>
  2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be
  hateful.
</p>
<p>
  3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise,
  and to do good.
</p>
<p>
  4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not
  good; he abhorreth not evil.
</p>
<p>
  5 Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the
  clouds.
</p>
<p>
  6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great
  deep: O Lord, thou preservest man and beast.
</p>
<p>
  7 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men
  put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
</p>
<p>
  8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou
  shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
</p>
<p>9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.</p>
<p>
  10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy
  righteousness to the upright in heart.
</p>
<p>
  11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the
  wicked remove me.
</p>
<p>
  12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not
  be able to rise.
</p>
