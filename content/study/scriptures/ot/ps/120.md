<p>1 In my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me.</p>
<p>2 Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.</p>
<p>
  3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false
  tongue?
</p>
<p>4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.</p>
<p>
  5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
</p>
<p>6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.</p>
<p>7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.</p>
