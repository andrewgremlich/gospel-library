<p>
  1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I
  was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
</p>
<p>
  2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will
  ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
</p>
<p>
  3 But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the
  Lord will hear when I call unto him.
</p>

<p>
  4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be
  still. Selah.
</p>
<p>5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.</p>
<p>
  6 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the
  light of thy countenance upon us.
</p>
<p>
  7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn
  and their wine increased.
</p>
<p>
  8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me
  dwell in safety.
</p>
