<p>1 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.</p>
<p>2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.</p>
<p>
  3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the
  battle. Selah.
</p>
<p>4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.</p>
<p>
  5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the
  men of might have found their hands.
</p>
<p>
  6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a
  dead sleep.
</p>
<p>
  7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once
  thou art angry?
</p>
<p>
  8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was
  still,
</p>
<p>9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.</p>
<p>
  10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt
  thou restrain.
</p>
<p>
  11 Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God: let all that be round about him bring
  presents unto him that ought to be feared.
</p>
<p>
  12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the
  earth.
</p>
