<p>1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</p>
<p>
  2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still
  waters.
</p>
<p>
  3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his
  name&#x2019;s sake.
</p>
<p>
  4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
  evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
</p>
<p>
  5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou
  anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
</p>
<p>
  6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
  will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
</p>
