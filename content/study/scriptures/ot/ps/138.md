<p>
  1 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise
  unto thee.
</p>
<p>
  2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy
  lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all
  thy name.
</p>
<p>
  3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with
  strength in my soul.
</p>
<p>
  4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they hear the
  words of thy mouth.
</p>
<p>
  5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: for great is the glory of the
  Lord.
</p>
<p>
  6 Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud
  he knoweth afar off.
</p>
<p>
  7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt
  stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand
  shall save me.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  8 The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth
  for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.
</p>
