<p>
  1 I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my
  foes to rejoice over me.
</p>
<p>2 O Lord my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.</p>
<p>
  3 O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me
  alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
</p>
<p>
  4 Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance
  of his holiness.
</p>
<p>
  5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may
  endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
</p>
<p>6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.</p>
<p>
  7 Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst
  hide thy face, and I was troubled.
</p>
<p>8 I cried to thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication.</p>
<p>
  9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust
  praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
</p>
<p>10 Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.</p>
<p>
  11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my
  sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
</p>
<p>
  12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Lord
  my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
</p>
