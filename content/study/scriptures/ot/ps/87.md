<p>1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.</p>
<p>2 The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</p>
<p>3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.</p>
<p>
  4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold
  Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
</p>
<p>
  5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the
  highest himself shall establish her.
</p>
<p>
  6 The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born
  there. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my
  springs are in thee.
