<p>
  1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.
</p>
<p>2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:</p>
<p>
  4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of
  Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
</p>
<p>6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.</p>
<p>7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.</p>
<p>
  8 For my brethren and companions&#x2019; sakes, I will now say, Peace be
  within thee.
</p>
<p>9 Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.</p>
