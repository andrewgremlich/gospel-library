<p>
  1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee,
  my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
</p>
<p>
  2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
</p>
<p>
  3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
</p>
<p>
  4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
</p>
<p>
  5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall
  praise thee with joyful lips:
</p>
<p>
  6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
</p>
<p>
  7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I
  rejoice.
</p>
<p>8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</p>
<p>
  9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of
  the earth.
</p>
<p>10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.</p>
<p>
  11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall
  glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
</p>
