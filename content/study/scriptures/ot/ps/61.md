<p>1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.</p>
<p>
  2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
  overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
</p>
<p>3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.</p>
<p>
  4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy
  wings. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of
  those that fear thy name.
</p>
<p>
  6 Thou wilt prolong the king&#x2019;s life: and his years as many generations.
</p>
<p>
  7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may
  preserve him.
</p>
<p>
  8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my
  vows.
</p>
