<p>1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
<p>
  2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together,
  against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,
</p>
<p>3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>
<p>
  4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
  derision.
</p>
<p>
  5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore
  displeasure.
</p>
<p>6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
<p>
  7 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this
  day have I begotten thee.
</p>
<p>
  8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the
  uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
</p>
<p>
  9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces
  like a potter&#x2019;s vessel.
</p>
<p>
  10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
</p>
<p>11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
<p>
  12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath
  is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
</p>
