<p>1 O sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the earth.</p>
<p>
  2 Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to
  day.
</p>
<p>3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.</p>
<p>
  4 For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above
  all gods.
</p>
<p>
  5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.
</p>
<p>
  6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
</p>
<p>
  7 Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory
  and strength.
</p>
<p>
  8 Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come
  into his courts.
</p>
<p>
  9 O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the
  earth.
</p>
<p>
  10 Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be
  established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
</p>
<p>
  11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and
  the fulness thereof.
</p>
<p>
  12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees
  of the wood rejoice
</p>
<p>
  13 Before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall
  judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
</p>
