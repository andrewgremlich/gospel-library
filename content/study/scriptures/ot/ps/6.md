<p>
  1 O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot
  displeasure.
</p>
<p>
  2 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are
  vexed.
</p>
<p>3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long?</p>
<p>
  4 Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies&#x2019; sake.
</p>
<p>
  5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give
  thee thanks?
</p>
<p>
  6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my
  couch with my tears.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine
  enemies.
</p>
<p>
  8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the
  voice of my weeping.
</p>
<p>9 The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer.</p>
<p>
  10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be
  ashamed suddenly.
</p>
