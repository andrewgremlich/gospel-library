<p>
  1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily
  oppresseth me.
</p>
<p>
  2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against
  me, O thou most High.
</p>
<p>3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</p>
<p>
  4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear
  what flesh can do unto me.
</p>
<p>
  5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.
</p>
<p>
  6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps,
  when they wait for my soul.
</p>
<p>
  7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.
</p>
<p>
  8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not
  in thy book?
</p>
<p>
  9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for
  God is for me.
</p>
<p>10 In God will I praise his word: in the Lord will I praise his word.</p>
<p>
  11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
</p>
<p>12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.</p>
<p>
  13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet
  from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
</p>
