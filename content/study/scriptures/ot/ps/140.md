<p>
  1 Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
</p>
<p>
  2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered
  together for war.
</p>
<p>
  3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders&#x2019; poison is
  under their lips. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  4 Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent
  man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
</p>
<p>
  5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the
  wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  6 I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O
  Lord.
</p>
<p>
  7 O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in
  the day of battle.
</p>
<p>
  8 Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device;
  lest they exalt themselves. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their
  own lips cover them.
</p>
<p>
  10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep
  pits, that they rise not up again.
</p>
<p>
  11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the
  violent man to overthrow him.
</p>
<p>
  12 I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the
  right of the poor.
</p>
<p>
  13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall
  dwell in thy presence.
</p>
