<p>
  1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in
  unity!
</p>
<p>
  2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the
  beard, even Aaron&#x2019;s beard: that went down to the skirts of his
  garments;
</p>
<p>
  3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of
  Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
</p>
