<p>
  1 Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also
  in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide.
</p>
<p>2 Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.</p>
<p>
  3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
</p>
<p>
  4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
</p>
<p>
  5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the
  wicked.
</p>
<p>
  6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O Lord:
</p>
<p>
  7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy
  wondrous works.
</p>
<p>
  8 Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine
  honour dwelleth.
</p>
<p>9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:</p>
<p>10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.</p>
<p>
  11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful
  unto me.
</p>
<p>
  12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the
  Lord.
</p>
