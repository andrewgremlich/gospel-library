<p>
  1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
  2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the
  workers of iniquity:
</p>
<p>
  3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their
  arrows, even bitter words:
</p>
<p>
  4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him,
  and fear not.
</p>
<p>
  5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares
  privily; they say, Who shall see them?
</p>
<p>
  6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the
  inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.
</p>
<p>
  7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
</p>
<p>
  8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see
  them shall flee away.
</p>
<p>
  9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall
  wisely consider of his doing.
</p>
<p>
  10 The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him; and all
  the upright in heart shall glory.
</p>
