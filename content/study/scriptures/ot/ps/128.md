<p>1 Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways.</p>
<p>
  2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it
  shall be well with thee.
</p>
<p>
  3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy
  children like olive plants round about thy table.
</p>
<p>4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.</p>
<p>
  5 The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of
  Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
</p>
<p>
  6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children&#x2019;s children, and peace upon Israel.
</p>
