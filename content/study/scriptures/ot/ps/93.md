<p>
  1 The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with
  strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that
  it cannot be moved.
</p>
<p>2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.</p>
<p>
  3 The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice;
  the floods lift up their waves.
</p>
<p>
  4 The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the
  mighty waves of the sea.
</p>
<p>
  5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for
  ever.
</p>
