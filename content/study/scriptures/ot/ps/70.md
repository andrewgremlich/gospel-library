<p>1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.</p>
<p>
  2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be
  turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
</p>
<p>3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.</p>
<p>
  4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as
  love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
</p>
<p>
  5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my
  deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying.
</p>
