<p>
  1 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that
  dream.
</p>
<p>
  2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then
  said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.
</p>
<p>3 The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</p>
<p>4 Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.</p>
<p>5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</p>
<p>
  6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come
  again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
