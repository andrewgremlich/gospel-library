<p>
  1 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set
  thy glory above the heavens.
</p>
<p>
  2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because
  of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
</p>
<p>
  3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
  stars, which thou hast ordained;
</p>
<p>
  4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou
  visitest him?
</p>
<p>
  5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him
  with glory and honour.
</p>
<p>
  6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put
  all things under his feet:
</p>
<p>7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;</p>
<p>
  8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through
  the paths of the seas.
</p>
<p>9 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!</p>
