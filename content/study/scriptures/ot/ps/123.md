<p>1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.</p>
<p>
  2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
  the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the
  Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
</p>
<p>
  3 Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly
  filled with contempt.
</p>
<p>
  4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease,
  and with the contempt of the proud.
