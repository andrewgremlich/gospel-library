<p>
  1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we
  remembered Zion.
</p>
<p>2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</p>
<p>
  3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they
  that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
</p>
<p>4 How shall we sing the Lord&#x2019;s song in a strange land?</p>
<p>5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.</p>
<p>
  6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if
  I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
</p>
<p>
  7 Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said,
  Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
</p>
<p>
  8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that
  rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
</p>
<p>
  9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the
  stones.
</p>
