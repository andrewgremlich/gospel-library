<p>
  1 In the Lord put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your
  mountain?
</p>
<p>
  2 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the
  string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
</p>
<span></span>
<p>3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p>
<p>
  4 The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord&#x2019;s throne is in heaven: his
  eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
</p>
<p>
  5 The Lord trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence
  his soul hateth.
</p>
<p>
  6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible
  tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
</p>
<p>
  7 For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the
  upright.
</p>
