<p>1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.</p>
<p>
  2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me?
  I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
</p>
<p>
  3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that
  turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
</p>
<p>4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.</p>
<p>
  5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an
  high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
</p>
<p>
  6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with
  me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
</p>
<p>
  7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies
  shall not tarry in my sight.
</p>
<p>
  8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all
  wicked doers from the city of the Lord.
</p>
