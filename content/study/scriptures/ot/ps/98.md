<p>
  1 O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his
  right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
</p>
<p>
  2 The Lord hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly
  shewed in the sight of the heathen.
</p>
<p>
  3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all
  the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
</p>
<p>
  4 Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise, and
  rejoice, and sing praise.
</p>
<p>
  5 Sing unto the Lord with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
</p>
<p>
  6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the Lord, the
  King.
</p>
<p>
  7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell
  therein.
</p>
<p>8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together</p>
<p>
  9 Before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall
  he judge the world, and the people with equity.
</p>
