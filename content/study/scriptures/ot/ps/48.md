<p>
  1 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the
  mountain of his holiness.
</p>
<p>
  2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the
  sides of the north, the city of the great King.
</p>
<p>3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</p>
<p>4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.</p>
<p>
  5 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.
</p>
<p>6 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>
<p>7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.</p>
<p>
  8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
  city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
</p>
<p>
  10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth:
  thy right hand is full of righteousness.
</p>
<p>
  11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy
  judgments.
</p>
<p>12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.</p>
<p>
  13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the
  generation following.
</p>
<p>
  14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto
  death.
</p>
