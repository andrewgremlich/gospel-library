<p>1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose
  spirit there is no guile.
</p>
<p>
  3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
</p>
<p>
  4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the
  drought of summer. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I
  will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity
  of my sin. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou
  mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh
  unto him.
</p>
<p>
  7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt
  compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will
  guide thee with mine eye.
</p>
<p>
  9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose
  mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
</p>
<p>
  10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord,
  mercy shall compass him about.
</p>
<p>
  11 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye
  that are upright in heart.
</p>
