<p>
  1 The earth is the Lord&#x2019;s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
  that dwell therein.
</p>
<p>
  2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
</p>
<p>
  3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy
  place?
</p>
<p>
  4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul
  unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
</p>
<p>
  5 He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God
  of his salvation.
</p>
<p>
  6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob.
  Selah.
</p>
<p>
  7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and
  the King of glory shall come in.
</p>
<p>
  8 Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in
  battle.
</p>
<p>
  9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and
  the King of glory shall come in.
</p>
<p>
  10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.
  Selah.
