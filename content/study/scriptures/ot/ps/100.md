<p>1 Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.</p>
<p>2 Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing.</p>
<span></span>
<p>
  3 Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
  ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
</p>
<p>
  4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be
  thankful unto him, and bless his name.
</p>
<p>
  5 For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to
  all generations.
</p>
