<p>
  1 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
</p>
<p>
  2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth
  in his heart.
</p>
<p>
  3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor
  taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
</p>
<p>
  4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear
  the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
</p>
<p>
  5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the
  innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
</p>
