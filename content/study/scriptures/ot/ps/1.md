<p>
  1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
  standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
</p>
<p>
  2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate
  day and night.
</p>
<p>
  3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth
  forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever
  he doeth shall prosper.
</p>
<p>
  4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
</p>
<p>
  5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the
  congregation of the righteous.
</p>
<p>
  6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly
  shall perish.
</p>
