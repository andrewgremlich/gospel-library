<p>
  1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness
  answer me, and in thy righteousness.
</p>
<p>
  2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
  living be justified.
</p>
<p>
  3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
  ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long
  dead.
</p>
<p>
  4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is
  desolate.
</p>
<p>
  5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work
  of thy hands.
</p>
<p>
  6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a
  thirsty land. Selah.
</p>
<p>
  7 Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest
  I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
</p>
<p>
  8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust:
  cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto
  thee.
</p>
<p>9 Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.</p>
<p>
  10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me
  into the land of uprightness.
</p>
<p>
  11 Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name&#x2019;s sake: for thy
  righteousness&#x2019; sake bring my soul out of trouble.
</p>
<p>
  12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my
  soul: for I am thy servant.
</p>
