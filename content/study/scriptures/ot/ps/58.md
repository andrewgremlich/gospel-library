<p>
  1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O
  ye sons of men?
</p>
<p>
  2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the
  earth.
</p>
<p>
  3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be
  born, speaking lies.
</p>
<p>
  4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder
  that stoppeth her ear;
</p>
<p>
  5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
</p>
<p>
  6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the
  young lions, O Lord.
</p>
<p>
  7 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow
  to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
</p>
<p>
  8 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely
  birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
</p>
<p>
  9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a
  whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
</p>
<p>
  10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
  feet in the blood of the wicked.
</p>
<p>
  11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily
  he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
</p>
