<p>
  1 How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy
  face from me?
</p>
<p>
  2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?
  how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
</p>
<p>
  3 Consider and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the
  sleep of death;
</p>
<p>
  4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me
  rejoice when I am moved.
</p>
<p>
  5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
</p>
<p>6 I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p>
