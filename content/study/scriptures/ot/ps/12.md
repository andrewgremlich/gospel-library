<p>
  1 Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the
  children of men.
</p>
<p>
  2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and
  with a double heart do they speak.
</p>
<p>
  3 The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh
  proud things:
</p>
<p>
  4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is
  lord over us?
</p>
<p>
  5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I
  arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
</p>
<p>
  6 The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth,
  purified seven times.
</p>
<p>
  7 Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation
  for ever.
</p>
<p>8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</p>
