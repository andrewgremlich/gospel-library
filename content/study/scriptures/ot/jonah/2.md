<p>1 Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish&#x2019;s belly,</p>
<p>
  2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard
  me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.
</p>
<p>
  3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the
  floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
</p>
<p>
  4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy
  holy temple.
</p>
<p>
  5 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round
  about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
</p>
<p>
  6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was
  about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my
  God.
</p>
<p>
  7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came in
  unto thee, into thine holy temple.
</p>
<p>8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</p>
<p>
  9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay
  that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
  10 &#xB6; And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the
  dry land.
