  1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their
  families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the
  uttermost part of the south coast.
</p>
<p>
  2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that
  looketh southward:
</p>
<p>
  3 And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to
  Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to
  Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:
</p>
<p>
  4 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt;
  and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south
  coast.
</p>
<p>
  5 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their
  border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part
  of Jordan:
</p>
<p>
  6 And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of
  Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:
</p>
<p>
  7 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so
  northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim,
  which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the
  waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel:
</p>
<p>
  8 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south
  side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top
  of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at
  the end of the valley of the giants northward:
</p>
<p>
  9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the
  water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border
  was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim:
</p>
<p>
  10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed
  along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and
  went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:
</p>
<p>
  11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border
  was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto
  Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
</p>
<p>
  12 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is
  the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
</p>
<p>
  13 &#xB6; And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
  children of Judah, according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua, even
  the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.
</p>
<p>
  14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and
  Talmai, the children of Anak.
</p>
<p>
  15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir
  before was Kirjath-sepher.
</p>
<p>
  16 &#xB6; And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to
  him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
</p>
<p>
  17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave
  him Achsah his daughter to wife.
</p>
<p>
  18 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her
  father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What
  wouldest thou?
</p>
<p>
  19 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give
  me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether
  springs.
</p>
<p>
  20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to
  their families.
</p>
<p>
  21 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the
  coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
