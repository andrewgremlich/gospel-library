1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.

2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaronâ€™s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments.

3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
